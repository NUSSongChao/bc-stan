# bc-stan

bc-stan provides code for the Bayesian calibration of Building Energy Models using the Stan modeling language. The stan code is based on [Kennedy and O'Hagan's (2001)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9868.00294/abstract) Bayesian calibration framework and follows the statistical approach described in [Higdon et. al. (2004)](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1064827503426693).

Stan is portable across [many computing environments](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/). Two interfaces ([R](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.R) and Python) are provided here to run the stan code.
